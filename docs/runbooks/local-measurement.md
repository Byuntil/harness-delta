# Local measurement

This is the legacy generic file-collection path. For first assigned A/B work, use
[the task procedure](workflow-quickstart.md) ([한국어](workflow-quickstart.ko.md)).

See the [Codex exact-version admission and partial measurement workflow](codex-version-admission.md) for 0.158.0 and subsequent candidate versions.


[한국어](local-measurement.ko.md)

Requires Node.js 24. Build with `npm ci && npm run build`; use `node dist/cli.js`
from this checkout, or `hm` from an installed local package. Installation does
not collect anything. This preview produces **partial observations**, not complete
task usage or adoption decisions. See [capabilities](../decisions/001-adapter-capabilities.md).

## Register and link

Choose opaque identifiers and fixed criterion IDs before work starts. Local root
and source paths are configuration; they do not enter reports. Replace the example
paths, model, session ID and version with the actual values for your dedicated session.

```sh
node dist/cli.js --db local.db project add project1 --root /path/to/project
node dist/cli.js --db local.db task register task1 --project project1 --type feature --size small --assignee user1 --product codex --model MODEL_ID --criteria criterion1
node dist/cli.js --db local.db task start task1
node dist/cli.js --db local.db session link SESSION_ID --task task1 --source /path/to/exact-session.jsonl --product codex --version 0.156.1
node dist/cli.js --db local.db collect --task task1
```

`--version` must match the actual product version. An exact registered version or
a stable release inside its declared file-source compatibility window is eligible;
conditional reuse remains unverified. See the version controls below.

Only explicit linked files are opened, after registered/active scope is checked.
No global transcript discovery occurs. The first poll establishes a baseline.
**Begin a new prompt/turn after collection starts.** A turn already running at
startup, restart or resume is excluded, including its later tool completions.
Keep collection running while working. Ctrl-C/SIGTERM stops it; nothing runs in
the background afterward. `--once` establishes a baseline and exits; repeatedly
invoking it does not measure work between invocations.

In another terminal:

```sh
node dist/cli.js --db local.db task pause task1
node dist/cli.js --db local.db task resume task1
```

Resuming starts a new baseline at the next poll. Stopping/restarting never backfills offline work.
Finalize only after the last source events have arrived and been collected.

For explicit new sessions, collector restarts and missing original sources, see
[continuing one task across sessions](session-continuation.md).

## Assess, report and delete

```sh
node dist/cli.js --db local.db task first-complete task1
node dist/cli.js --db local.db task assess-first task1 --result failed
node dist/cli.js --db local.db task rework task1
node dist/cli.js --db local.db task finalize task1 --outcome success --met criterion1
node dist/cli.js --db local.db report task task1 --cutoff 2030-01-02T12:00:00Z --format json
node dist/cli.js --db local.db delete task task1
```

Supply your actual report cutoff, not the illustrative date. Human outcome and
criterion fulfillment are explicit; a passing test never finalizes a task.
Finalization is immutable. A new requirement belongs in a new task.

Reports show observed token components and partial sums, outcome, rework, elapsed
and active time, plus known command/Bash executions. Cached inputs are subsets of
normalized total input; do not add them again. Complete totals, general tool-failure
counts, model runtime, cost, search/read classification, duplicate reads, context
expansion, and first edit/test/oracle times remain null where unsupported. Missing
is not zero. A first explicit Codex cumulative zero is retained when eligible;
repeated unchanged cumulative notifications are not new observations. Baseline
and uncertain-interval exclusions still apply. Claude message replay keeps its
original attribution; conflicting metadata remains an error. See the
[diagnostic categories](../decisions/003-local-observation-contract.md#collector-failure-diagnostics)
for the local collector interface and its limits.

Retention is opt-in. This example deletes tasks finalized more than 30 days ago
and retains active tasks. The last command deletes the project and related rows.

```sh
node dist/cli.js --db local.db retention set project1 --days 30
node dist/cli.js --db local.db retention apply project1
node dist/cli.js --db local.db delete project project1
```

Tombstones prohibit identifier reuse. Prior report files and original product transcripts are outside
local DB deletion. The separate [synthetic file exchange](team-file-exchange.md)
uses deletion notices and tombstones; live sharing and central sync remain unavailable.

## Preregister an observational period

Copy [the period example](../../examples/period.json), set future windows and all
eligibility fields, and register before the first window starts:

```sh
node dist/cli.js --db local.db period register --config period.json
node dist/cli.js --db local.db report period period1 --cutoff 2030-03-01T00:00:00Z --format markdown
```

Settings are immutable and versioned. Cohorts use task start in half-open windows
`[start,end)`, not completion date. Each task is followed for the specified hours;
results after its follow-up cutoff are excluded. Reports remain provisional until
the second enrollment window plus follow-up has ended. Composition and all eligible
outcomes remain visible, including failures, abandonment and missing usage.
Complete means/change rates remain unavailable while coverage is partial.
JSON and Markdown contain the same snapshot and a metadata-only fingerprint.
The same DB data, settings and cutoff reproduce the same period report. Preserve
the generated report if you need a historical snapshot after deletion or new data.

## Versions, conformance, and update controls

Implemented 2026-10-08: [ADR 013](../decisions/013-forward-version-compatibility.md)
enables automatic conditional parser reuse for stable releases inside finite windows.
File collection uses Codex 0.158.0 for newer versions below 0.164.0, and Claude Code
2.1.283 for newer versions below 2.2.0. Codex CLI 0.161.0 and Claude Code 2.1.293/2.1.294
therefore enroll by default with `compatibility_unverified` trust. Exact registered
versions remain verified; prereleases, suffixes, old unregistered versions and
out-of-window releases fail before source access.

Usage records preserve actual product version, parser/profile and rule revision.
Task reports show unverified tokens under `usage.compatibility_unverified`;
`usage.partial_tokens` includes only verified observations. Provenance-less historical
native usage appears under `usage.legacy_unverified`. Cost reports separate
`compatibility_unverified_partial_amount` and `legacy_unverified_partial_amount`.
An all-unverified task has a null verified total, not a false zero. All data stays partial.

```sh
node dist/cli.js --db ./local.db compatibility status
node dist/cli.js --db ./local.db compatibility inspect --product codex --version 0.161.0 --source file
node dist/cli.js --db ./local.db compatibility inspect --product claude_code --version 2.1.293 --source file
node dist/cli.js --db ./local.db compatibility invalidate --product codex --version 0.161.0 --source file --reason semantic_incompatibility
```

Expected: inspect returns actual version, selected parser and trust; invalidate
returns `invalidated`. Required-contract failures block that version/source cohort,
stop further reads, and exclude its earlier estimates on subsequent reports and
repricing. Blocks survive restart. Diagnostics use fixed metadata-only categories.
Preserve affected exported snapshots as unreliable; local invalidation cannot recall
external copies. A repair requires synthetic reproduction, a reviewed named parser
variant where semantics changed, focused tests and the full check before clearing a
block. There is no automatic or user-facing unblock shortcut.

Registered exact file adapters remain partial: Codex CLI 0.156.1/0.158.0 and Claude
Code 2.1.283. Codex 0.158.0 covers sequential partial usage under the M2 boundaries.
See [ADR 007](../decisions/007-adapter-version-profiles.md). File compatibility does
not authorize native launch; use the separate workflow windows in the
[native workflow guide](task-native-workflow.md).

For developer conformance, exact-version registration and native update controls,
use the [admission procedure](codex-version-admission.md). These are manual,
separately authorized validation steps, never part of installation or collection.

## Recovery and limits

Errors use fixed codes. Source identity changes, truncation, invalid scope/version,
conflicting metadata, resets or unsupported topology exclude the uncertain batch.
Stable same-size Claude modifications retain the baseline only when validated
measurement metadata is identical; changed usage, origin, model, timestamp or
recognized tool IDs still fail closed. This does not establish raw-content equality.
Earlier observations remain partial. Correct the explicit mapping and restart;
recovery establishes a new baseline and does not import earlier work. Sources over
16 MiB are unsupported in this initial bounded reader. It scans a bounded authorized
snapshot per poll; this is not an unbounded production log tailer.

Run `npm run check` for synthetic acceptance tests, including the CLI flow, privacy
sentinel, rollback, pause/restart and reports. This generic collector's evidence covers
macOS arm64, Codex CLI 0.156.1/0.158.0 and Claude Code 2.1.283 only. App sessions,
parent/child complete accounting, nonzero reasoning semantics, other versions and
other platforms need separate validation. Do not use this preview for a real
experiment or inferential adoption decision.

For the additive v2 flexible model workflow, explicit prices and independent
readiness gates, see [flexible comparison](flexible-comparison.md). The separate
[assigned Codex 0.160.0 root workflow](task-native-workflow.md) admits partial
own-response collection under a complete frozen v2 protocol. It does not change
this generic collector's exact admissions or conditional parser rules. Complete cost and inference remain
unavailable.
