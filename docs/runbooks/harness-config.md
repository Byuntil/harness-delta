# Portable harness configuration

[한국어](harness-config.ko.md)

## 1. Prepare selected files

Use Node 24 and a built Harness Delta checkout:

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
```

In the target project, select existing Markdown instructions and only the related
files you intend to pin. Prepare `harness-notes.md`: purpose, project-root manual
application, dependencies, selected-file limits and manual verification. Tool
commands remain manual. Registration copies exact bytes and preserves originals.

Expected layout:

```text
harness-config/
├── baseline/
│   ├── harness.md
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── manifest.json
│   └── scripts/search.py
├── v2/
│   ├── harness.md
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── manifest.json
│   └── scripts/search.py
└── comparisons/baseline-vs-v2.json
.harness-delta/setup/
├── baseline-vs-v2-<revision-hash>.json
└── tasks/<task-id>.json
```

`harness-config` is suitable for deliberate Git sharing. Inspect selected files
before publishing them. Private local bindings belong in ignored
`.harness-delta/setup`; keep that directory out of Git. The revision suffix allows
multiple reviewed local settings without replacing historical task pins.

## 2. Register baseline and modified versions

Create a selected input file outside the generated version directory:

Keep artifact `source_path` files outside the entire `harness-config/` directory.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "harness_id": "search",
  "version": "baseline",
  "policy_version": "policy-v1",
  "readme_path": "harness-notes.md",
  "artifacts": [
    {"artifact_id":"instruction","role":"instruction","source_path":"policy.md","target_path":"harness.md"},
    {"artifact_id":"search-tool","role":"tool","source_path":"scripts/search.py","target_path":"scripts/search.py"}
  ]
}
```

Run from the built Harness Delta checkout:

```sh
node dist/harness-config-main.js register --root /path/to/project --input /path/to/register-input.json
```

Expected result: `registered`; exact repeats return `already_registered`. To
register the modified files, change `version` to `v2` and optionally add
`"base":{"path":"harness-config/baseline/manifest.json"}`. Run the same command.
An existing version with different bytes fails with `harness_version_conflict`.
Do not edit a published version; select a new version.

Paths use portable ASCII components within the project. Absolute paths,
traversal, symlinks, case-folding collisions and Windows device names are rejected.
The primary instruction targets `harness.md`. Select at most 255 artifacts;
the README copied from `readme_path` adds one entry, for at most 256 manifest artifacts.
Each file is limited to 1 MiB, with 16 MiB total. Missing selected files and unresolved inline
local Markdown links block publication. Command strings, reference-style links,
remote links and dependency closure are not fully validated. Supply missing
files explicitly or describe unselected prerequisites and limits in the README.

## 3. Generate the portable comparison

Create a comparison input:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "id": "baseline-vs-v2",
  "name": "Baseline vs v2",
  "arm_a": "baseline",
  "arm_b": "v2"
}
```

```sh
node dist/harness-config-main.js compare --root /path/to/project --input /path/to/comparison-input.json
```

Expected result: `generated`; exact repeats return `already_generated`. Different
contents under an existing ID fail with `shared_settings_conflict`. The pair
contains relative manifest references and hashes. Baseline is A; modified is B.
It contains no model/effort, local DB identities or experimental defaults.
Tool-only changes alter the whole-bundle digest even when instruction hashes
remain unchanged. Hashes show integrity, not authenticity or actual use.

The optional repository reference packages are
[harness-register](../../skills/harness-register/SKILL.md) and
[harness-compare-config](../../skills/harness-compare-config/SKILL.md). Their
helpers require an explicit `--harness-delta` checkout; no global plugin is
required. Installing a skill is separate from creating a harness snapshot.

## 4. Connect on each PC

First complete the existing [reviewed local setup prerequisites](local-browser-ui.md)
and [comparison registration](task-comparison.md): registered project, ordered
compatible variants, frozen protocol, criteria, price basis and reviewed execution
settings. This feature does not create or freeze those records. Copy the shared
harness-config files into the registered project checkout.

1. Open Local UI → Setup and choose the comparison JSON file.
2. Read snapshot integrity and separate A/B original-tool compatibility.
3. Select the registered project and reviewed local measurement settings explicitly.
4. Select **Connect local settings**.

Expected result: private immutable JSON appears in `.harness-delta/setup` and the
setup is available for new tasks. An exact repeat reports an existing connection.
Import reads no sessions and starts no task, tool, agent or model. Missing
registration or an incompatible ordered pair remains blocked. Display names do
not identify a setup; explicit IDs distinguish equally named entries.

For startup after binding:

```sh
node dist/cli.js --db /path/to/local.sqlite ui --setup /path/to/project/harness-config/comparisons/baseline-vs-v2.json
```

No matching revision fails with `shared_binding_required`. Multiple revisions
fail with `shared_binding_selection_required`; choose one explicitly:

```sh
node dist/cli.js --db /path/to/local.sqlite ui --setup /path/to/project/harness-config/comparisons/baseline-vs-v2.json --setup-binding-revision shared-<revision-hash>
```

Use an actual private revision ID. Existing legacy reviewed manifests remain
supported. Different runtime templates create separate revisions for future
tasks; they do not update existing task pins.

## 5. Prepare and measure

Create a task using the connected setup. Task and A/B assignment IDs are reserved
and retained through interruptions. A preparation blocker remains visible;
correct the original selected files manually, then retry the same task. Never
restore tools from the snapshot automatically or rerandomize to a matching arm.
Follow the existing prepare/apply/new-session/connect flow. Start actual work only
after the current workflow permits observation.

During observation, changed or missing snapshot/private/original-tool files stop
collection. In-flight uncertain data is discarded; retained observations, partial
cost, window, assignment and outcomes remain readable. Correction requires an
explicit continuation/reconnect; no automatic resume or backfill occurs.

Snapshot integrity does not establish native startup order, instruction loading,
actual tool execution or dependencies. Existing exact-version and forward-version
labels remain unchanged. See the [current native support limits](task-native-workflow.md)
and [ADR 014](../decisions/014-portable-harness-config.md). No complete task cost,
statistical adoption decision or new native admission follows from this feature.

If the selected descriptor changes after preview, Connect fails with `shared_preview_changed`; import it again and review it. Revision IDs and reviewed template/runtime choices distinguish settings in the task chooser. Bindings for a deleted project do not transfer when the same directory is registered again. Private JSON remains local; archive or remove obsolete private files deliberately after historical work is no longer needed.

## 6. Agent application (format 2)

Use format 2 when the assigned bundle contains an application procedure that
adapts project rules and scripts. Register both versions normally, then generate:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "id": "agent-baseline-vs-v2",
  "name": "Agent baseline vs v2",
  "arm_a": "baseline",
  "arm_b": "v2",
  "application": "agent_applied"
}
```

1. Import the comparison, bind a reviewed local template and prepare the task.
   The UI stores assignment without applying files or starting collection.
2. Select an existing checkout/worktree and Codex or Claude Code. Inspect its
   branch and HEAD. Prepare the native session context. Retry preserves assignment;
   no branch switch or new worktree is automatic.
3. Request a fresh native session. On macOS with an installed CLI this requests a
   Terminal interactive session with the prepared prompt. The installed grammar
   was checked for Codex CLI 0.161.0 and Claude Code 2.1.295; actual native opening
   and agent acceptance are unverified. Desktop prompt deep links and other
   platforms are unsupported. If unavailable or failed, open a fresh session in
   the selected target yourself and paste the copyable application context.
4. The session's own agent uses harness-apply, reads the assigned bundle,
   investigates domains and edits target files directly. It discovers output
   paths as needed and checkpoints each file before editing. Preserve unrelated
   dirty/untracked files. Decide file and command permissions in the native window.
5. Inspect actual changes and check outcomes in the UI after editing. File hashes
   are independently verified for the reported set. Script/check outcomes remain
   `agent_reported`; missing, refused and failed outcomes are visible. This is not
   an exhaustive filesystem or tool audit. There is no publish approval.
6. After verified application, copy the populated working-session guidance. Open
   a separate fresh session in that target and invoke harness-connect there.
   File application does not prove generated-instruction loading or measurement
   readiness. Existing identity/loading/source gates remain in force; these
   working-session routes are qualification-pending for this feature.

Application helper operations are `context`, `checkpoint`, `identity`, `report`
and `status`. Use the installed skill path and Node 24. Checkpoints retain actual
dirty bytes and absent states; a missing baseline is rejected, never replaced with
Git HEAD. Reports contain hashes and bounded check IDs/outcomes, not source bytes,
secrets or command output. Hidden paths, symlinks/hardlinks, private DB paths and
sidecars, registered bundles, node_modules and known secret paths are unsupported.
Each file is limited to 1 MiB and an attempt to 256 checkpointed paths.
Checkpoint/report HTTP bodies and helper input files are limited to 1 MiB; other
mutation routes keep their 16 KiB transport limit.

Copy fallback is not evidence of automatic opening. Opening acknowledgement is
not evidence that an agent started. Repeated opening clicks do not request another
window for the same attempt. Abandon an attempt before explicitly retrying opening.
If current files drift after completion, abandon the old attempt and prepare a
new one; preserve and inspect those user edits. Abandonment and server restart
never stop or relaunch the native agent or roll back files. Stop it in its native
window. Stale helpers and deleted tasks remain fenced. Deletion removes product-owned
review/launch artifacts while preserving workspace edits and opaque application
session exclusions. Unsafe/replaced private roots report `application_cleanup_pending`;
restore the intended private directory and retry deletion. Tasks stay deleted.

Application role registration requires a supported metadata-only identity provider.
The current Codex root receipt integration retains its exact-version limits.
Claude's application identity resolver is unavailable; file application remains
visible, while subsequent connection is blocked. Never identify a session from
cwd or an agent claim. Do not run harness-connect in the applying session.

See [ADR 015](../decisions/015-agent-harness-application.md). Synthetic tests validate
wiring and integrity only; separately authorized native acceptance remains required
for opening, adaptation, scripts, permissions and working-session loading.
